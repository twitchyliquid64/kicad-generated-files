# kicad-generated-files
Includes trace inductors generated using the lovely spiral_inductor.py by ignamv.

Currently, this repository contains inductors which can be used on a KiCad circuit board design. The naming scheme represents its size in mm, the characteristic frequency, capacitance value (if used in a tank circuit) etc.
